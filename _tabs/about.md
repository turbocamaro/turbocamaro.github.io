### The Origin Story
It all started in 2007, on a brisk spring evening as I continued the search for a new vehicle; somthing cheap, fuel efficient snd reliable (**Spoiler Alert:** I failed in my quest). After giving up on Craigslist and Kijiji offerings I turned to Ebay. I stumbled upon a $9,400 navy blue 1967 Camaro with a 250ci Inline 6 snd a Turbo Hydramatic 350 transmission. I don't think I even saved the auction at first as i didnt know much sbout Inline 6's but assumed it would be underpowered and unsatisfying to drive (I got that right at least). However after a few days of mulling on it, I realized it was a unique moment in time where the Canadian dollar was a slight value above the US dollar, therby making the auction cheaper than listed. I recognized the deal and ended up taking it for thr list price. Shipping was arranged from California to Washington where I crossed the border and deove it home. I took it to Canadian Tire and it passed inspection after replacing just the windshield wipers. I often think about how lucky I was not gettting ripped off by the seller or the shipping company. I got what I paid for, a solid body 67 Camaro in need of TLC and a revitalized power plant. Thr stsge was set for a real rags to riches story, a lot like Cinderella Man or Pretty Woman, but without the boxing or prostitution.

### YouTube Startup

After the first drive home I relaized the suspension was tired and would be the first upgrade. After just buying the Camaro I didnt have the money to spend a thousand plus on parts, so I bought perioud correct V8 coils and Monroe shocks. I decided to film a good portion of the swap, which eventually became the first filmed video for Turbo Camaro. I started filming a lot of upgrades from the headlights, bodywork, paint prep and even regulsr oil changes. I wanted to document the transformation of thr csr, not yet reslizing the direction it would go.

### A Brand was Born

Fast forward to 2013, the Camsro spent a lot of time in storsge where I tinkerer with it and noted the cracked paint. Some family budgeting was done but there was no way to afford the local price quotes of $20,000+ for paint and body work. Until one day when **Rolled On Forums** was discovered. The forums provided detailed and proven methods of rolling regular metal rust paint on a vehicle and having them look as good as spray jobs. The first thought was, there is no way it will look good and definitely won't last (it didn't). So, every page of every project was read and notes were taken. I gained a lot of confidence in the "$50 Rustoleum Paint Job" theory. Since the materials would only cost $200-300 and the rest was just time and effort, the wife gave two thumbs up and it was time to get started.

It was at this point Turbo Camaro was born. Sure, there was an interest in turbochargers, but the idea of doing everything "in house" and documenting it for everyone was a newfound hobby in itself. With the paint job completed in 2015 and the engine build underway, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to bring as many interested parties along as this classic car went through a meticulous transformation to a unique, daily driven, turbocharged performance vehicle.

### Powerplant Potential




### The Philosophy
I’m a firm believer in doing the work yourself. From a $50 Rustoleum roll-on paint job that lasted years to the current **Holley Sniper EFI** integration, every modification has been documented with the pros and especially the cons. If a part failed or a tune was off, I've shared it here so others don't make the same mistakes.

### Why the Inline-6?
While everyone else was dropping LS engines into F-bodies, I wanted to see exactly what the "Leaning Tower of Power" (and its bigger cousins) could do with modern boost. It’s unique, it’s challenging to tune, and it requires a level of fabrication and patience that a crate engine just doesn't demand.

### Current Specs (The TL;DR)
* **Engine:** 260ci Inline-6 (Evolution of the 250)
* **Induction:** Custom Turbocharged setup
* **Management:** Holley Sniper EFI (Self-tuned)
* **Mission:** A reliable, streetable, and surprisingly quick tribute to doing things the hard way.

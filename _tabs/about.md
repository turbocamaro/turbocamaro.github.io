## The Frank Truth Behind TurboCamaro

This isn't a "checkbook build." This project started in **2007** with a $3,000 budget and an eBay purchase that most people would have walked away from. What began as a budget-conscious restoration has evolved over **19 years** into a deep-dive into unconventional engineering: turbocharging a **260ci Inline-6** in a 1967 Camaro.

### The Philosophy
I’m a firm believer in doing the work yourself. From a $50 Rustoleum roll-on paint job that lasted years to the current **Holley Sniper EFI** integration, every modification has been documented with the pros and especially the cons. If a part failed or a tune was off, I've shared it here so others don't make the same mistakes.

### Why the Inline-6?
While everyone else was dropping LS engines into F-bodies, I wanted to see exactly what the "Leaning Tower of Power" (and its bigger cousins) could do with modern boost. It’s unique, it’s challenging to tune, and it requires a level of fabrication and patience that a crate engine just doesn't demand.

### Current Specs (The TL;DR)
* **Engine:** 260ci Inline-6 (Evolution of the 250)
* **Induction:** Custom Turbocharged setup
* **Management:** Holley Sniper EFI (Self-tuned)
* **Mission:** A reliable, streetable, and surprisingly quick tribute to doing things the hard way.

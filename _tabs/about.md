### The Origin Story
In 2007, I set out to find a cheap, fuel-efficient daily driver. Instead, I found a $9,400 Navy Blue 1967 Camaro on eBay. It had a 250ci Inline-6 and a TH350 transmission—a combination I assumed would be underpowered and unsatisfying. I was right, but the timing was perfect: the Canadian dollar was strong, the body was solid, and the stage was set for a "rags-to-riches" story. It was like *Cinderella Man* or *Pretty Woman*, but without the boxing or the prostitution.

### YouTube & The DIY Grind
After driving it home, the tired suspension became the first priority. Being a family man on a budget, I skipped the high-end kits for period-correct V8 coils and Monroe shocks. I decided to film the swap, which became the first video for **Turbo Camaro**. What started as a way to document a transformation eventually became a newfound hobby in itself.

### A Brand was Born
By 2013, the budget still couldn't support a $20,000 professional paint job. I refused to let the project stall, so I turned to the **Rolled On Forums**. I spent weeks researching the "$50 Rustoleum Paint Job" theory—applying rust paint with a foam roller. With $300 in materials and a massive amount of "sweat equity," I got to work.

### Why the Inline-6?
While everyone else was dropping LS engines into F-bodies, I wanted to see what the "Leaning Tower of Power" could do with modern boost. It’s unique, challenging to tune, and requires a level of fabrication and patience that a crate engine just doesn't demand. There is nothing better than shattering misconceptions when people see what a machine an old straight-six can become.

### The Horizon: The Best is Yet to Come
From 2007 to 2025, the focus was foundation. 2026 marks the shift from building to sending it. With the Holley Sniper dialed, alcohol injection firing, and a chassis finally ready for the load, we are entering the high-output era. 

We are no longer just chasing reliability; we are chasing the limits of the 250ci. This car is a 20-year testament to the fact that you don't need a six-figure shop to build something extraordinary. You just have to be willing to do it the hard way.

### The Origin Story
It all started in 2007, on a brisk spring evening as I continued the search for a new vehicle; something cheap, fuel-efficient, and reliable. (**Spoiler Alert:** I failed in my quest). After giving up on Craigslist and Kijiji offerings, I turned to eBay. I stumbled upon a $9,400 navy blue 1967 Camaro with a 250ci Inline-6 and a Turbo Hydramatic 350 transmission. I didn't even save the auction at first; I didn't know much about Inline-6s and assumed it would be underpowered and unsatisfying to drive. (I got that right at least). 

However, after a few days of mulling it over, I realized it was a unique moment in time where the Canadian dollar was at a slight value above the US dollar, making the auction cheaper than listed. I recognized the deal and ended up taking it for the list price. Shipping was arranged from California to Washington, where I crossed the border and drove it home. It passed inspection at Canadian Tire after replacing just the windshield wipers. I often think about how lucky I was not getting ripped off by the seller or the shipping company. I got what I paid for: a solid body '67 Camaro in need of TLC and a revitalized power plant. The stage was set for a real rags-to-riches story—a lot like *Cinderella Man* or *Pretty Woman*, but without the boxing or the prostitution.

### YouTube Startup
After the first drive home, I realized the suspension was tired and would be the first upgrade. Having just bought the car, I didn't have the money to spend a thousand-plus on parts, so I bought period-correct V8 coils and Monroe shocks. I decided to film a good portion of the swap, which eventually became the first video for Turbo Camaro. 

I started filming everything from the headlights and bodywork to paint prep and regular oil changes. I wanted to document the transformation of the car, not yet realizing the direction it would eventually go.

### A Brand was Born
Fast forward to 2013: the Camaro had spent a lot of time in storage where I tinkered with it and noted the cracked paint. Some family budgeting was done, but there was no way to afford the local price quotes of $20,000+ for paint and body work. Then I discovered the **Rolled On Forums**. The community provided detailed, proven methods of rolling regular metal rust paint on a vehicle and making it look as good as a spray job. My first thought was that there was no way it would look good, and it definitely wouldn't last.

I read every page of every project and took notes. I gained a lot of confidence in the "$50 Rustoleum Paint Job" theory. Since the materials were actually $200-$300 and the rest was just time and effort, the wife gave two thumbs up and it was time to get started.

It was at this point Turbo Camaro was born. Sure, there was an interest in turbochargers, but the idea of doing everything "in house" and documenting it for everyone was a newfound hobby in itself. 

### Why the Inline-6?
While everyone else was dropping LS engines into F-bodies, I wanted to see first-hand exactly what the "Leaning Tower of Power" could do with modern boost. It’s unique, it’s challenging to tune, and it requires a level of fabrication and patience that a crate engine just doesn't demand. I’ve built faith in what these old warhorses can do. There is something to be said about raising eyebrows and shattering misconceptions when people see what a machine an old straight-six can become.

### The Horizon: The Best is Yet to Come
From 2007 to 2025, the focus was on restoration and getting the foundation right. But 2026 marks a shift from building to optimizing. With the Holley Sniper dialed in, the alcohol injection firing, and a chassis finally capable of handling the load, we are entering the high-output era of this project.

The most ambitious chapters of the Turbo Camaro story haven't been written yet. We are no longer just chasing reliability; we are chasing the limits of what a 250ci straight-six can achieve on a budget. This isn't just a car; it's a 20-year testament to the fact that you don't need a six-figure shop to build something extraordinary.

### The Mission: To build a reliable, streetable, and surprisingly quick tribute to doing things the hard way.

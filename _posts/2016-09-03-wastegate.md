As mentioned in the [blow off valve article](/posts/blow-off-valve/){:target="_blank"}, it was important to find a wastegate capable of competing with the big name brands without paying big prices. 

The wastegate is mounted between the exhaust ports on the cylinder head and the inlet port on the turbocharger. As the exhaust gasses leave your engine they build up in the manifold as they enter the turbo. If the exhaust pressure in the manifold exceeds the desired amount of boost, the wastegate opens and allows the exhaust to bypass the turbocharger and leave the vehicle through the exhaust pipe/muffler.



After literally days of researching, the brand **SPA Turbo** was identified as a solid company that does their own R&D and manufacturing in Brazil. Brazil is well known in the inline forums as they have an active inline 6 drag racing community. A SPA Turbo compact 35mm stainless steel wastegate was purchased off eBay for $65US.

Upon receipt of the wastegate it looked really good. The only real downside is the proprietary 3-bolt "S" flange. You can buy individual "S" flanges separately to make a custom mounting plate, but keep in mind that trading the hassle for a more common 2-bolt version usually triples the price.

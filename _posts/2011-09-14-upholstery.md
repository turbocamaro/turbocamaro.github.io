The great thing about classic cars is the availability of aftermarket and OEM parts. However, just because you can order new interior components doesn't mean you should give up on your originals. 

One of the most cost-effective changes you can make is refreshing your upholstery. Carpets, package trays, and door panels can often be restored rather than replaced. We used **SEM Classic Coat Fabric and Vinyl spray** to change the original Marina Blue items to a classic black. (Note: Don't bother trying this on carpet; the texture will never be right).

To do this properly, everything must come out. Unbolt the seats and remove the door panels. The [headliner](/posts/headliner/){:target="_blank"} underwent a similar transformation. Get these items far away from the car, as overspray is incredibly difficult to remove from glass or fresh paint.

Preparation is everything. Vacuum the seats and clean them thoroughly with a product like **SEM Vinyl Prep**. If you're on a strict budget, Windex works in a pinch, provided you give it ample time to evaporate. 



We recommend using a fine 3M abrasive pad on the vinyl before spraying. This "opens the pores" of the material to help the spray bond. Be sure to do a test area first to ensure you aren't leaving visible scratches. Once scuffed, do a final wipe-down with cleaner.

Spray using smooth, light passes. Mist the first coat, use the second for 80% coverage, and finish with a third to lock in the color. This process held up well for nearly five years until the 40-plus-year-old vinyl finally began to crack from age. When the bench seat finally gave out, we used hog ring pliers and a standard black cover to fix it—a simple DIY job for any weekend warrior.

By late 2015, the lack of support in the original springs and foam became apparent. We eventually retired these originals for a set of [Scat Procar Rally 1000 buckets](/posts/scat-procar-rally-1000-seats/){:target="_blank"}.

Turbo Camaro is all about DIY modern technology in a daily driver. Part of that includes electrical system, safety, and cosmetic upgrades. Just like upgrading to LED interior lighting, replacing your exterior bulbs covers all three.

It's very easy to find replacements for Camaro signal, brake, and reverse light bulbs. Ensuring your signals are bright is important, but for safety, the brake and reverse lights are paramount. Increasing visibility during day and night driving is essential to a smooth drive. Stock bulbs work, but there is significant room for improvement.

Turbo Camaro's brake/signal bulbs were replaced with a 20 LED RapidFire panel. Not only are they significantly brighter than stock, but they fill the entire red lens. With every depress of the brake pedal, they blink rapidly to ensure the motorist behind you is paying attention. This is one of the most useful safety features installed on the car.

The front turn signal bulbs are regular white bulbs with an orange coating. They work, but they get extremely hot and aren't nearly as efficient as a multi-LED version. When selecting a replacement, make sure you choose a bright amber/orange; some darker versions don't "pop" as well through the housing.

What about the reverse lights? LED is whiter and brighter than stock. You could almost use them as headlights at night if you had a desire to drive around in reverse.

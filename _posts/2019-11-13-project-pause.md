At this point, the reality of the situation had set in. I already knew that the [First Engine Build](/posts/engine-failure-identified/) was a complete failure, and the project was essentially stuck. With the car sitting dormant, I started to worry about how the elements were affecting the [rolled-on Tremclad paint job](/posts/rolling-tremclad-paint/). High-performance parts are one thing, but letting the body rot while waiting for a mechanical solution is a mistake I wasn't willing to make.

The best move for now was to focus on preservation. When your priorities as a family man need to align with a hobby that currently feels like a money pit, you have to be disciplined enough to wait. 

<div style="display: flex !important; flex-direction: column !important; width: 100% !important; flex-grow: 1 !important; margin: 1.5rem 0 !important;">
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/carparked_201113/IMG_20201113_164102.jpg" alt="Car covered for storage" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;">
  <p style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin-top: 5px;"><em>Covered up and preserved. Saving up for the next chapter.</em></p>
</div>

This isn't the end of the road for Turbo Camaro; it's just a hiatus. The goal is to keep the body protected and continue saving money until I can resume the project with a better plan and the right people to help finish the job.

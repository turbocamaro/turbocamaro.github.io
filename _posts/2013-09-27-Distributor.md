Turbo Camaro's Chevy 250 inline-6 was manufactured in 1968, and let's face it: technology has improved over the decades. While we aren't swapping the whole engine, identifying outdated components like the ignition system is a great way to bring the car into the modern era.

The stock distributor used a points system which worked well in its day, but in 1974, GM introduced **High Energy Ignition (HEI)**. HEI integrates the coil into the distributor cap and replaces mechanical points with a magnetic pickup and control module. It's more reliable, produces a hotter spark, and requires significantly less maintenance.

We opted for an "eBay special" HEI distributor with a 65,000-volt coil for about $65US. Despite the budget price, it's a solid piece that has been starting the car reliably since 2014.

The installation was straightforward: we referenced the #1 cylinder tower, pulled the old coil and distributor, and dropped the HEI unit in. Because the HEI cap is significantly larger, the fuel line needed some "massaging" to clear the housing. We also had to swap to HEI-specific spark plug wires and replace the original resisted coil wire with a dedicated 12-gauge 12V lead.

### 2018 Update: Electronic Timing Control
In January 2018, this distributor was gutted and "locked out" to allow for electronic timing control via our [Holley Sniper EFI System](/posts/holley-sniper-efi/){:target="_blank"}. 

You don't need an expensive brand-name distributor for electronic timing if you're willing to modify your HEI. We removed the weights, springs, and vacuum canister, locking the mechanical advance so the Sniper ECU can handle the timing curve. All the original internals now sit in a Ziploc bag in the trunk—just in case we ever need to revert to a standalone ignition roadside.

For the full breakdown on the lockout process, check out the [Holley Sniper EFI](/posts/holley-sniper-efi/){:target="_blank"} page.

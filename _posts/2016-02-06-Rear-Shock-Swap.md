The front springs were replaced and the shocks were swapped. Replacing shocks is very easy on these old cars. A shock and a couple bushings and your cruisin' in comfort. It'll actually take you longer to remove the wheel and jack up the car than it will to swap out the shock.

That being said, if you've never done it before or are interested in the difference between modern and late model mechanics, the shock swap was filmed for your viewing pleasure. In the video, a pair of standard Monroe shocks were installed but Turbo Camaro currently rides with Monroe MaxAir shocks. The original blue Monroe's were kept for future use.

The mechanical weak spot on all '67 Camaros is the factory mono-leaf springs. Turbo Camaro was even further guaranteed to have mono-leafs as it was ordered with an inline-6, and all first-generation Camaros with 6's received them.



Mono refers to the single leaf spring in your rear axle suspension. Most 1968-69 V8 Camaros received multi-leaf suspension (4 or 5 leaves) for added firmness and longevity. After decades of use, mono-leaf springs stay permanently flexed and sag. To upgrade, you can heat-treat old springs or add a "helper" spring, but the best budget-friendly performance move is a mono-to-multi conversion.

Turbo Camaro received a 3-leaf conversion. To save money, parts were sourced individually: springs and HB-1000 bushings from [sdtrucksprings.com](http://www.sdtrucksprings.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=9589){:target="_blank"}, and heavy-duty U-Bolts (1/2" gauge, 3.5" wide, 6" long) locally. 

**Pro Tip:** Inspect your shackles before you start. Replacing them usually requires dropping the gas tank, so don't commit to new ones unless you're ready for the extra work.

Be careful with your brake lines; moving the axle during the swap can easily snap a brittle line. Throughout the process, keep all bolts finger-tight. Only torque the mounting points and U-Bolts once the car is back on the ground with its full weight distributed. Tightening them while the car is on stands can cause an uneven stance and binding issues.

The 3-leaf springs raised Turbo Camaro approximately 1/2" and significantly firmed up the rear end. This is a perfect setup for a performance daily driver. If you're building a dedicated drag car, you'll want to look at 4-5 leaf packs and specific traction bars.

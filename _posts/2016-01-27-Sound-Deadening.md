Your only real option is to invest in some sound deadening materials. This topic isn't a 10 minute read, you can literally spend days of your life researching the pros and cons of deadening. You'll learn about decibels, frequencies, vibrations, temperature changes, foil, rubber&nbsp;and a variety of plastics and&nbsp;combinations of everything. You'll even find people who have plastered roofing compounds over their entire ride. Turbo Camaro gets its fair share of budget projects, but it'll never get that bad.

Once it was decided to rebuild Turbo Camaro's Inline 6, a machine shop needed to be selected. Several calls were made, but eventually **Thompson Machine Ltd.** in Nanaimo, British Columbia was selected. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to discuss the build. One other shop actually asked, "Why would you want to rebuild a straight 6?!" in a heavy tone—it was clear they didn't want the job. If you're going to spend $1200US, make sure the workmanship is solid and the people deserve your business.

The list of services completed by Thompson Machine included:

* **Clean & Qualify:** No cracks found in the block.
* **Ultrasound Check:** Cylinders checked for wall thickness; cylinder 6 was the thinnest at 0.134", well within spec.
* **Rod Work:** Removed old pistons and upgraded to ARP connecting rod bolts.
* **Crankshaft:** Polished and drilled/tapped the nose for a retainer bolt and balancer tool.
* **Bearings:** Supplied new Crankshaft and Camshaft bearings.
* **Timing Gear:** Heat-pressed on a new CompCams steel gear.
* **Machining:** Decked the block head surface and bored/honed cylinders for 0.070" over-bore pistons.
* **Balancing:** Full rotating assembly balanced.

Some of these services were mandatory due to the custom forged pistons and intended power increase. While you can technically heat-press a gear at home using a freezer and an oven, having the shop do it properly while they have the assembly ensures it's done right without the risk of a kitchen-table disaster.

Initially, the rod bolts were going to stay stock, but with the investment in the internals, they were the weakest link. The stock cast Crankshaft and forged rods are robust, but with custom pistons and boost, ARP bolts make the bottom end "bulletproof" for a pro street application.

Balancing the rotating assembly is not a mandatory rebuild service for stock engines, but for Turbo Camaro it was essential. With custom forged pistons, an aggressive cam, and steel gears, the weight distribution is significantly different from stock. Skipping the balance would result in heavy vibrations that cause premature part failure. Even at $100–$200, it’s cheap insurance for the longevity of the motor.

Don't rush when choosing a shop. A friendly, genuinely interested machinist is hard to find, but worth the effort. And a little tip: a box of fresh donuts for the guys in the back goes a long way toward getting them invested in your project.

A lot of time and effort went into selecting a turbocharger. With branding like **Turbo Camaro**, it would be unfortunate to use a junk turbo and end up blowing it in the first 20 minutes. It was decided to avoid selecting a big name like Garrett or Turbonetics as they were too expensive and didn't fit in the big picture.



The final name was **CXRacing**. They have the most positive reviews for a budget turbocharger brand. Since turbochargers are complex engine parts and require precise installation, it is expected to see some cases of negativity, but many users have run these in twin setups for years without issue.

After all that, a **CXRacing T4 GT35 0.68 AR** turbocharger kit was ordered off eBay for $280US. The kit came with the required gaskets and oil/water fittings. The specifications were exactly what the build needed to ensure a quick spool while maintaining decent cruise speeds.

A lot of time and effort went into selecting a turbocharger. With branding like "Turbo Camaro" it woul be unfortunate to use a junk turbo and end up blowing it in the first 20 minutes. It was decided to avoid selecting a big name like Garret or Turbonetics as they were too expensive and didn't fit in the big picture. Also, no scrap yard deals or cheap crap. It was decided to follow the same selection strategy as the   and  . 
With so many horror stories and negative reviews of products purchased off eBay, it can seriously dissuade a potential buyer. Even with all the negativity, you can't tell me their isn't at least one inexpensive, reputable, high quality turbocharger brand on eBay. The process started with writing down all the names of the brands that wern't too expensive or look like complete garbage. The initial list was googled and searched on multiple forums and names were slowly but surly crossed off. 
The final name was CXRacing. They have the most positive reviews for a budget turbocharger brand, but they do have a few negative ones too. Since turbochargers are complex engine parts and require precise installation it is expected to see some cases of negativity from the client. Most of the issues observed in negative reviews were related to condition upon receipt or issues caused by customers not inspecting their part prior to install. On a positive note, a lot of strong reviews were read with customers using CXRacing turbochargers for in high horsepower twin setups with no issues and several had been using them for years without issue. When reading reviews online you need to be objective as it's considerably more likely for a mad customer to write a review than it is for a happy one.

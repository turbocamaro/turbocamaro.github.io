The ongoing theme of **Turbo Camaro** is to add modern components while keeping a classic look. This concept can become a challenge and really test build intentions. Stereo systems are important to passengers for entertainment, but a deck from 1967 just isn't acceptable for a modern driver.

The idea of installing a fancy multi-disc bluetooth super stereo in a hidden compartment was explored but didn't meet the "cool factor" criteria. The stereo included with this Camaro was a first-generation CD player hardly worth turning on, so there was no stock unit to digitize. 

Further exploration revealed **RetroSound**. They have designed a modular deck with interchangeable kits capable of mimicking the appearance of classic radios while offering top-end modern functionality. A RetroSound Model 2B Motor 3 Stereo was ordered, but upon receipt, there was only time to open the box...

Despite the almost overwhelming number of pieces in the box, the install was completed in a few hours and the results were fantastic...

Several requests were made to make a concise review of the stereo. Many reviews already exist on YouTube but none to date of this specific model installed in a '67 Camaro. Take a look at the review below:

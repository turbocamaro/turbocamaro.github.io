Turbo Camaro received [upholstery work](/posts/upholstery/){:target="_blank"} early on, but it was determined the stock bucket seats weren't going to cut it for a performance build. New seats were sought out and a set of black **Scat Procar Rally 1000 Smoothback** seats were purchased. 



A set of '67 Camaro specific mounting brackets were picked up at the same time. While it wasn't a difficult install, some modification was required to obtain an ideal seat height. Stock floors in these cars are high, and the Scat brackets often sit the seat higher than factory, which can be an issue for taller drivers.



The following film will enlighten you on the process of fitting these seats and addressing the bracket height.

<div style="display: flex !important; flex-direction: column !important; width: 100% !important; flex-grow: 1 !important; margin: 1.5rem 0 !important;">
<div style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhV1KCaTSR0?feature=player_embedded" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The final result provides a much more modern "cockpit" feel with side bolsters that actually keep you in place during cornering, unlike the original flat buckets.

When you are running boost on a 250 inline-6 with high compression or limited cooling, detonation (knock) is the engine killer. To combat this, we decided to install a **DevilsOwn Alcohol Injection Kit**. By injecting a fine mist of water/methanol into the intake charge, we can significantly lower intake air temperatures and increase the effective octane of the fuel.



The kit includes a heavy-duty 300 PSI pump, a pressure switch (to trigger the spray at a specific boost level), and an injection nozzle. For the **Turbo Camaro**, we are mounting the nozzle in the charge pipe, just before the carburetor hat.

One of the best "bang-for-your-buck" aspects of this kit is that it allows us to run more aggressive timing and boost on standard pump gas without needing to buy expensive race fuel. Plus, the steam created in the combustion chamber helps keep the valves and piston tops "steam cleaned" and free of carbon buildup.

The installation is straightforward, but you have to be meticulous with the wiring and plumbing. A leak in the methanol line near a hot manifold is a recipe for a fire you can't see (alcohol burns clear). We opted for braided lines and high-quality fittings to ensure it stays sealed.

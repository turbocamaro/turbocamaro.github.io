Every vehicle needs seat belts, but classic muscle cars often leave you with tough choices regarding safety versus style. Turbo Camaro came equipped only with lap belts. The originals had been swapped for junk-yard specials decades ago, so a full refresh was mandatory. While a 4-point harness is a "future-proof" safety idea, it’s often too restrictive for a daily driver.

We decided on a hybrid setup: year-correct retractable lap belts for the front seats and stylish aftermarket "airplane" lift-latch buckles for the rear bench. The chrome buckles are smaller and look much cleaner when tucked into the back seat. This mix gives the car a unique, custom look while ensuring every passenger has a functional restraint.

### Child Safety Anchors
Transporting children in a 1967 vehicle presents a serious safety hurdle. In British Columbia, child seats must be anchored to a rear mount tether. While the law is lighter on vintage cars not originally equipped with them, common sense says your children deserve the best chance of survival. 



We installed two universal child seat tethering anchors through the rear window package tray. To ensure these are "invincible," we tossed the cheap 1" washers that came in the kit and replaced them with **2" wide, 1/4" thick fender washers**.

The anchors are sandwiched through the metal tray and secured to the sturdiest area in the trunk. Little black rubber caps were added to the bolt heads to prevent reflections off the rear glass. It’s a simple modification that catches people's eyes and adds a much-needed layer of modern safety to a 50-year-old car.

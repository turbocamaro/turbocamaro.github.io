I had scoured the internet for a solid daily driver—something good on gas, maybe newer than 2002, but I wasn't too picky. Then, I came across a base model 1967 Camaro for less than $10,000 Canadian. It was a California car, complete with an inline 6 and a bunch of sun damage to the paint. Obviously, it would have been nice to find a mint condition V8 runner, but good luck finding that for less than $10k. I had always wanted a 1967 Camaro, and now, when I wasn't even looking for one, here it was practically begging me to buy it.

I won the auction, and the seller helped arrange transport to Blaine, Washington, where I picked it up in person.

I followed the permit and import process, had the mandatory inspection, and got it registered in Canada without issue. Even in that short drive home, I knew I had my work cut out for me. The car was in need of bodywork and paint, but it was otherwise stock and ready for daily driving or tinkering.

It was the perfect candidate for a younger guy who wanted a long-term project car that might just be stable by the time he retired. It’s funny to think back to this moment—not knowing then that this "stable" project would eventually turn into a turbocharged Inline 6 odyssey.

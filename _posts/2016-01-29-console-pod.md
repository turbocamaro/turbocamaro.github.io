Gauge technology sure has improved over the years. Vehicle manufacturers have come up with clever ways of mounting gauges these days, too. Not that there's anything wrong with simple dash clusters or aftermarket pods, but there's something to be said about smooth, built-in gauges. 

The '67 Camaro had a simple 2-gauge cluster, and if you had a center console, you might have been graced with a 3-gauge pod. The console pod was a good idea but not well executed, as it looked aftermarket right out of the factory. 



Turbo Camaro needed something new but not a far stretch from what the factory offered. It was decided a place for four 52mm gauges was needed. An aftermarket bolt-on four-gauge pod is available for the 68-69' Camaro, but the '67 wasn't invited to the party. Turbo Camaro decided to retrofit the available pod to fit the '67's console. In the end, everything got cut up and turned out well. A half-hour documentary was filmed covering the planning, execution, and outcome.

Further updates will be posted here once the console is reinstalled and the gauges are functioning.

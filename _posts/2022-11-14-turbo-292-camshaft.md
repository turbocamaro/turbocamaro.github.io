After the great engine failure of 2018, I spent years deciding whether to proceed with what seemed like the ever growing money pit of the Turbo 250 Inline 6 or bring in a new dependable crate 350. It's a debate I pondered over for years before even starting the original 250 build, and nothing had changed... it was a destiny not yet fulfilled.

With the lobes on the previous custom grind wiped out from a poorly configured top end, I needed a replacement. In the peak of the Covid era, finding parts was a nightmare, so I turned to Tom Lowe at [12bolt.com](http://www.12bolt.com/). Tom had a "Turbo 292" camshaft in stock that was compatible with my 250 and perfect for a turbocharged daily driver wanting to run on pump gas.

> **Pro-Tip from 12bolt:** The Chevy 250 can use a 250 or 292 cam. You'll have to use an electric fuel pump if a 292 cam is used in a 250. However, a 292 must use a 292 cam to clear the rods.

  <p style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin-top: 5px;"><em>The official Comp Cams card: .495" gross valve lift, 212° duration at .050", and a 113° lobe separation.</em></p>
</div>

These specs are ideal for a turbocharged daily driver 250. The 113° lobe separation (LSA) helps reduce overlap, which prevents the intake charge from being blown out the exhaust under boost. With a duration of 212° at .050", the cam remains mild enough to maintain decent vacuum and a smooth idle, ensuring the car is manageable in traffic while still having the "legs" to make real power when the turbo spools up. It is a solid compromise that stays within the limits of pump gas without requiring a high-stall converter or aggressive gearing.

I ordered the cam through Tom, and it came in good order. We provided the cam to the new machine shop in preparation for the fresh build and they were very happy with the fit and finish. Stick around to see if we can actually get this one to stay in one piece.

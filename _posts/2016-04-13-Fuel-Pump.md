A turbocharged engine could easily run with the stock mechanical fuel pump if you never went into boost. However, for those of us that want to actually use the components we install, the stock fuel pump won't keep up. There are only a few options to get around the stock pump limitations:

* **High Volume Mechanical Pump:** Keep the engine looking stock without adding electrical devices. The [Airtex 42152](http://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=58890&cc=1030903&jsn=453&jsn=453){:target="_blank"} is a direct swap ($18US) and handles up to 8 PSI.
* **Small Block Conversion:** Convert a [Carter Super Strip (M4891)](http://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=296888&jsn=__GIX__3__){:target="_blank"} to fit. It's capable of 9.5 PSI and costs around $72US.
* **Boost Referencing:** The cheapest method. Modify your current pump by feeding a pressurized line from the intake to the pump diaphragm. This pushes fuel at the current PSI to the carb and functions well up to 14 PSI.
* **Electric Fuel Pump:** The most expensive and difficult to install, but dependable and powerful.

In April 2016, the stock mechanical pump was boost referenced. I used a 3/8" nylon outlet from a Spectre fuel filter as a hose nipple inlet. A hole was drilled in the pump below the diaphragm, the inlet was attached with JB Weld, and the stock vent holes were sealed.

The modified pump was used for approximately one year without issue up to 8 PSI. It was eventually removed to install the [Holley Sniper EFI](/posts/holley-sniper-efi/){:target="_blank"} setup. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [ian@turbocamaro.ca](mailto:ian@turbocamaro.ca).

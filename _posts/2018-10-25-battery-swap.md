  <p style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin-top: 5px;"><em>The 10-year-old Sears DieHard 665MF. A solid unit that finally gave up the ghost.</em></p>
</div>

After a decade of service, the Sears DieHard 665MF was officially toast. Rated for 1035 cranking amps (875 cold), it was a powerhouse in its day, but it could no longer hold a charge. For a car like Turbo Camaro, which is constantly evolving with power hungry accessories and the high torque demands of a built engine, having a reliable reserve is mandatory.

A Group size 65 is admittedly a large battery for a '67 Camaro engine bay. It takes up a significant amount of room, but that extra physical size translates to the kind of power benefits this car needs. This is the new standard size for Turbo Camaro.

</div>

The replacement is a Kirkland Signature 207180, rated at 1000 cranking amps (850 cold). Despite the size, it fits into the factory battery tray perfectly. The top posts also clear the body support rail without any issue, so there's no concern about accidental grounding. 

One of the biggest selling points for going with Kirkland is Costco's awesome pro-rated warranty and their "no questions asked" replacement policy. For a project car that might sit during the winter or undergo long periods of downtime during a build, that kind of peace of mind is worth every penny.

It's a simple swap, but it ensures the car actually turns over when we need it to.

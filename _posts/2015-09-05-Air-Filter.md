Once you opt to run a turbocharger, many of the external components must be modified or replaced. Like most vehicles of the era, the stock air cleaner was a ring shape housed in a circular dish. The stock enclosure was actually well-designed for a low profile, acquiring air via a long snout. However, this won't work with a turbo setup as the top of the carb is now occupied by the [carburetor hat](/posts/hat-bonnet/){:target="_blank"}.

The new air supply is positioned in front of the turbocharger. While enclosed factory-style filters exist for turbos, cost-effective open-air filters like the **Spectre 8131** are much easier to package. This black cone filter includes three sets of mounting rings, allowing it to fit 3", 3.5", or 4" inlets. It is approximately 6"x7" and washable for easy maintenance.



Since the filter is relatively compact, it can be mounted directly to the turbocharger inlet, or with some planning, relocated closer to the grille or wheel well. Ideally, you want it positioned away from significant heat sources like the exhaust manifold or the engine block to keep the intake charge as dense as possible.

Final install documentation and images will be posted here upon completion.

Deciding to drop the manual steering for power was a major turning point for the build. While manual offers excellent feedback at highway speeds, power steering is far more responsive for a daily driver, especially when navigating tight parking lots. Turbo Camaro deserved the upgrade to make it a more capable street machine.

There are several ways to tackle this swap:
* **OEM Restoration:** Sourcing original power steering parts from a donor car or forum.
* **IROC-Z Box Swap:** Using a later-model IROC Camaro gearbox for a tighter, more modern steering ratio.
* **Rack and Pinion:** The high-end route that brings the car into the realm of modern handling, but at a massive cost to the budget.

**Pro Tip:** If you want modern steering feel on a budget, look for the "secret menu" IROC-Z gearbox swap. While a factory '67 power box has a slow ratio (about 16:1), an 85-92 IROC-Z or Z28 box offers a fast 12.7:1 ratio. It bolts into the factory location with minor modifications to the rag joint and hose fittings, giving you sports-car steering for a fraction of the price of a rack and pinion.

We opted for a factory-restored complete kit for the Chevy 250, purchased for about $350US. It included a restored gearbox, pump, rag joint, and the specific inline-6 brackets.

There is something satisfying about giving a car a factory option it never had. While a rack and pinion system would have been nice, this restored setup provides a night-and-day difference in drivability without breaking the bank. 



If you're planning this swap, make sure you verify the bracket fitment for the inline-6; V8 brackets will not work. You'll also need to source a belt, as those are rarely included in these kits.

I was well aware the turbo setup was running hot. The stock radiator was probably fine for a standard 250, but this car is far from stock now. On hot days, the temperatures would easily creep above 200 degrees at stoplights. With the underlying head and piston ring issues already looming, Turbo Camaro wasn't getting much TLC in late 2019. Personal matters meant both money and time were tight, so I looked for the simplest solution to mitigate the rising heat.

I decided to swap out the stock 4-blade mechanical fan for a Flex-a-lite 417. This is a 17-inch, 6-blade nylon fan designed for high performance applications. It is incredibly lightweight, features a slim 2" width, and is rated to handle up to 8,000 RPM.

### Fan Physics: 4 Blades vs 6
The math on this swap is straightforward. Increasing the blade count and surface area directly increases the volume of air moved (CFM) at lower RPMs, which is exactly where the car was struggling. While a stock 4-blade fan is often inefficient at idle, a 6-blade fan with an aggressive pitch can pull significantly more air through the core while the car is stationary. 

This isn't a magic cure for an overheating system, but it should slow down the temperature rise and buy more time before the needle hits the danger zone. One major hurdle remains: finding a proper fan shroud for this model has been impossible. Without a shroud, the fan pulls air from the engine bay rather than through the radiator core, losing a massive amount of efficiency. I suspect I will eventually have to fabricate a custom one to truly solve the airflow issue.

Planning a custom engine is daunting; picking the right carburetor for a turbo inline-6 is the ultimate challenge. Before we go any further, let's consider the options. Turbo Camaro was a factory carbureted vehicle, but it doesn't need to stay that way. While modern EFI systems offer laptop tuning and easier cold starts, there are three rock-solid reasons to stick with a carburetor:
* **Cost:** It is roughly 10 times cheaper to rebuild a quality carb than to buy a full EFI kit.
* **Simplicity:** No wires to fry, no modules to fail, and no sensors to calibrate.
* **Installation:** Easier initial hardware setup that doesn't require a computer to fire up.



The downside is tuning. Carbs are a "hands-on" puzzle of jets, pumps, and valves. For a turbocharged Chevy 250 with 9:1 compression and 0.070" over pistons, we narrowed it down to two options: the Holley 350 CFM 2-barrel or the **Holley 600 CFM 4-barrel Double Pumper**. We chose the 600 because its mechanical secondaries allow for precise control over when those extra barrels open to feed the turbo's demand.

We picked up a used unit for $100 and a high-performance rebuild kit for $50. If you're doing this yourself, take "before" pictures of every linkage and screw. Clean everything in aluminum-safe Simple Green, then blast every passage with carb cleaner. 



### Mounting and Clearance
To mount the Holley 4776 to the Offenhauser 5416 manifold, you need a **Trans-Dapt 2090 adapter**. More importantly, you **must** use at least a 1/2" spacer. Without it, the Holley throttle linkage will slam into the middle flange of the intake manifold. Be warned: between the manifold, adapter, spacer, and carb hat, hood clearance becomes non-existent. We had less than 1/2" of room left for the wing nut!

> **2017 Update:** The Holley 600 was eventually replaced by a [Holley Sniper EFI](/posts/holley-sniper-efi/){:target="_blank"}. While the carburetor was 100% capable of running the engine, the Sniper's ability to electronically manage the fuel curve and timing control (via the [eBay GM HEI distributor](/posts/distributor/){:target="_blank"}) offered a "set it and forget it" reliability that better suited our daily driving needs. The carb remains in the hall of fame as the most competent mechanical device ever installed on this car.

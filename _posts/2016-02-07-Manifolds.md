The Chevy 250 inline 6 was designed as a solid workhorse motor, making them perfect for trucks and daily drivers. Unfortunately these motors weren't designed for power and most of the components need to be mortified for replaced to defy the power constraints.


The stock exhaust manifold has a 2" outlet and narrower passages. 2" is tight for larger turbos and decent exhaust air flow. Since Turbo Camaro is getting turbocharged and using 3" piping, the stock 2" manifold just isn't going to cut it. The exhaust manifold from a 292 has larger passages and the outlet is 2.5". Even though it's only 0.5" bigger, that's 25% more air flow and the larger passages bump it closer to 30-40%, which is a significant upgrade.


Turbo Camaro received a 292 exhaust manifold that was originally on a tractor. The manifold was purchased off eBay for about $100US. Since this is a stock style manifold, it wasn't designed to run a turbo and doesn't have a port for a . Some custom manifold like the SPA Turbo manifold have a built in wastegate outlet and the main outlet has a T3/T4 outlet instead of the 250/292's 3 bolt version. The 292 manifold will eventually be modified to accept the . Why didn't Turbo Camaro get the SPA Turbo manifold to match the wastegate? The SPA Turbo manifold costs over $400US that's why. Updates to follow.


As with the exhaust manifold, the stock intake manifold manifold is solid, but doesn't support an increase in power. Luckily their are several aftermarket intake manifolds that do.

When building a turbo system on a budget, you have to decide where to save and where to spend. For the **Turbo Camaro**, the Blow Off Valve (BOV) was an area where we felt we could find a high-quality "no-name" part. A blow off valve's job is simple: when you let off the throttle and the butterfly closes, the pressurized air needs somewhere to go so it doesn't "surge" back into the turbo compressor.



We selected a **Wyntonm 38mm** unit from eBay. It's a knock-off of a much more expensive brand, but the machining quality on this specific unit was surprisingly high for $35US. It features a dual-spring design and came with the required aluminum weld-on flange and O-ring.

The real test is in the diaphragm. Most cheap BOVs fail because the rubber diaphragm is thin and tears under heat. Upon inspection, the Wyntonm unit uses a reinforced silicone diaphragm that feels sturdy enough to handle the 10-15 psi we are aiming for.

If you're looking for that "pssh" sound without the $250 price tag, this is a solid choice. We will update this page with a video of the valve in action once the car is back on the road.

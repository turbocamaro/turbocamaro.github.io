If you thought you were done when you picked the colors of your vehicle, now you can consider decorations like decals and painted stripes. Turbo Camaro went with a factory-provided bumblebee stripe. The car didn't get one from the factory, but this ain't no showroom, so who cares.

Whether you decide to do a simple stripe or a full mural, you have to choose between paint and decal. Using the bumblebee as the example, you have four options:



* **DIY Mask & Paint:** Mask the vehicle using online measurements. This costs only materials and gives you total control.
* **Stencil Kit:** Purchase a "factory correct" stencil. This ensures the correct stock curves without the measuring headache.
* **Decal Kit:** The easiest DIY method and easily removable. However, classic cars didn't use decals; if you want the "real" look, paint it on.
* **Professional Shop:** The most expensive, but the way to go if you have zero confidence in your masking skills.

Turbo Camaro's bumblebee was done with method 1. Originally, the stripe was going to be integrated into the [rolled-on black paint](/posts/rolling-tremclad-paint/){:target="_blank"}, but that would make future repairs or color changes a nightmare. We opted to spray it on after the black paint had gassed out.

The stripe was painted with **Anthracite Grey Plasti-Dip**. It’s a subtle metallic rubberized coating that repels water and can be peeled off if we ever change our minds.

Measurements were pulled from various forums. It's clear the factory didn't treat these as a perfect science, as several original cars had slight variations in gaps and sizes. The pencil sketches on this page were our primary guide.

To prep, clean the area with denatured alcohol—wipe on, wipe off. We used 2" and 1/8" green painters tape. Overspray travels far, so mask off the entire front end, including the windshield.

Apply 2-3 light "mist" coats first, then a medium coat. The secret to a crisp line with Plasti-Dip is removing the tape **immediately** while the paint is still wet. If you wait for it to harden, the rubber will bridge to the tape and create jagged, peeling edges.

If you've taken the time to paint your own car, you might as well do your own stripe. It’s an afternoon of masking for a lifetime of personality.

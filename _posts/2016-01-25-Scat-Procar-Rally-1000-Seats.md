Turbo Camaro received <a href="http:s//www.turbocamaro.ca/2016/01/upholstery.html" target="_blank">upholstery work</a> early on but it was determined the stock bucket seats weren't going to cut it. New seats were sought out and a set of black Scat Procar Rally 1000 Smoothback seats were purchased. A set of 67' Camaro specific mounting brackets were picked up at the same time. It wasn't a difficult install, but some modification was required to obtain ideal seat height. The following firm will enlighten you on the process.<br />

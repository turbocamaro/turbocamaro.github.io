Unfortunately the 67' Camaro came with an insecure hood latch assembly. Anyone could literally lift the latch above the grille and open the hood to expose the engine. Once there it wouldn't take much to steal from or sabotage the engine.

Obviously you could consider an <a href="http://www.turbocamaro.ca/2017/10/alarm-system-power-locks.html">alarm system</a>, but that might be a little overkill for some people. Perhaps just having alternate hood security is all you need. This is why we went with the hood locks in addition to an alarm system (you can't be too careful).Whether you consider simple hood pins or locks, you'll want to ensure they're stainless steel otherwise they'll rust and ruin the cosmetic appeal.

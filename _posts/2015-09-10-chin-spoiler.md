Spoilers are a popular way of adding aerodynamic attitude to a vehicle. The first-generation Camaro was blessed with the option to have not one, but two spoilers. Most people are familiar with the trunk lid spoiler, but the lower valance front "chin" spoiler is equally iconic. It gives the front end the appearance of a lower stance and forms a more aggressive shape.



Turbo Camaro was destined to have a chin spoiler, regardless of what factory options it had. It's such a small part of the car and consists of a large piece of molded plastic and a few support brackets. You can get the whole kit for around $50US, and it takes no more than 20 minutes to install. 

The installation was filmed and uploaded to YouTube for your reference.

If you're looking for an easy afternoon project that makes a noticeable difference in how the car sits, this is it. Just be careful with steep driveways—plastic spoilers don't have much give.

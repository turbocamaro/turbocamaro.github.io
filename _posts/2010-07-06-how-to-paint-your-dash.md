</div>

Turbo Camaro's factory interior was Marina Blue—a classic, but the goal is to modernize the feel without losing the '67 soul. In the world of performance builds, black is king.

To refresh the dash, everything must come out: the dash pad, steering wheel, instrument cluster, heater controls, glove box, and every single "doohickey." Painting these components inside the car is a recipe for overspray disaster. Mask off the floors, seats, and glass with plastic drop sheets before you even touch a sandpaper block.

Preparation is 90% of the work. We used 150-grit followed by 220-grit sandpaper to ensure a smooth surface. Any imperfection left in the metal will be amplified by the paint. Clean the area with a wax and grease remover or a quick-evaporating cleaner like Windex before spraying.



For the finish, we used a **Trim Black Semi-Gloss Etching Primer** and **Rustoleum Universal Gloss Black**. 

**Important:** We did not paint the top of the dash with gloss. High-gloss paint on the dash top creates a brutal reflection on the windshield in direct sunlight. Use a **Satin or Matte** finish for the top surface to keep your visibility clear.

Don't forget the small details like the ash tray and glove box door. The '67 Camaro features a tire pressure decal on the inside of the glove box. Instead of paying $10 for a replacement sticker, we spent an hour replicating the factory art and printing it on sticker paper for about 10 cents.

Spray multiple light coats to avoid runs on the vertical surfaces. If you rush it and cause a drip, you're back to the sanding phase.

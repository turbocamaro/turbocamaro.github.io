I always found the 292 exhaust manifold's 3-bolt flange wasn't ideal for holding the weight of a turbocharger on an up-pipe. Supporting brackets helped, but the original design and downward angle simply worked against the build during the [first build](/posts/turbocharger/). When researching performance parts for the Chevy Inline 6, you realize quickly that options are limited, especially for high quality exhaust manifolds.

I eventually sourced a specialized manifold from SPA Turbo. Based in Brazil, SPA Turbo has a massive global reputation for producing heavyduty, high performance turbo components for platforms that the mainstream market often ignores. This specific manifold features a robust 4-bolt T3 pattern exhaust outlet and a separate proprietary wastegate flange. A high performance Remflex Intake/Exhaust gasket was used by [Island D Automotive Machine](https://www.islanddautomotive.ca/) for the install.

The design is convenient because the [CX Racing Turbocharger](/posts/turbocharger/) and a matching [SPA Turbo Wastegate](/posts/wastegate/) could technically bolt right on. However, in the cramped engine bay of a '67 Camaro, the shock tower and engine mounts are completely in the way. While a large truck might have the clearance for a direct mount, this car required a more creative solution.

The manifold was pre-painted black, and a custom up-pipe was crafted to relocate the turbo to a mid-bay position. This provides a much cleaner look and allows for a more central location for the hot side components. The trade-off is that the downpipe will now need to be custom fitted, but the short runipes and familiar orientation should make that a straightforward task.

### Pro Tips for Turbo Manifolds
* **Check Flange Flatness:** Even high-end cast manifolds like those from SPA should be checked with a straight-edge before installation. If it isn't perfectly flat, you will fight exhaust leaks forever.
* **Use Quality Studs:** Do not use standard Grade 8 bolts for the turbo-to-manifold connection. Use high-temp Inconel or stainless studs with locking nuts to prevent them from backing out due to heat cycles.
* **Support the Weight:** Even with the robust 4-bolt T3 flange, the up-pipe and turbo still put stress on the manifold. Fabricating a simple support brace from the engine block to the turbo flange is cheap insurance against cracked welds.

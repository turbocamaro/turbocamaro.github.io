The 19-year saga of the turbocharged 260ci Inline-6 Camaro has a new home. 

I am currently migrating nearly two decades of build logs, tuning maps, and fabrication guides from the old Blogger site to this new high-performance home. 

### What's Coming:
* **The Full Build History:** From the 2007 eBay purchase to the current Holley Sniper setup.
* **Tuning Data:** Actual maps and lessons learned from boosting the I6.
* **Video Archives:** Integrated YouTube guides for specific F-body mods.

Stay tuned while I move the data over. The "no-nonsense" truth about this build isn't changing—just the garage it lives in.

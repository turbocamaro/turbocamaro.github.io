As I move toward rebuilding the 250 Inline 6, I knew the Turbo Hydramatic 350 (TH350) had to go. Not only did I find a crack in the body, but the lack of an overdrive gear just doesn't fit the daily driver goals I have for Turbo Camaro. After keeping an eye on Marketplace, I found the perfect candidate: a 700R4 pulled from a 1992 Chevy Camaro. 

The 1992 model year is widely considered the holy grail of factory 700R4s for several reasons:
* **Internal Lubrication**: It features the most advanced internal oiling circuits developed before GM moved to the electronic 4L60E.
* **Input Shaft**: By 1992, the 30-spline input shaft was standard, providing much better strength than the earlier 27-spline versions.
* **Hard Parts**: This final iteration included all the factory-strengthened components like the 10 vane pump and improved sun gear shells.

This unit was recently factory refreshed and came with the lines still attached. While the 700R4 isn't known for being a bulletproof racing transmission in stock form, it should have no problem holding up to my driving style and the power levels I'm aiming for.

</div>

Before this can go in, I’ll need to shorten the driveshaft, source a cable-driven speedometer housing, and pick out a torque converter. The actual installation and those components will be documented later.

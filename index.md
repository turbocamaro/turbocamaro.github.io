# Project: 1967 Turbo Camaro

Follow along and witness a transformation as this base model 1967 Chevrolet Camaro receives custom fabrication and modern styling all backed by a turbocharged alcohol injected highly modified 250 cubic inch inline 6 engine. No big sponsors or corporate bill folds, every upgrade is completed by a regular guy on a family conscious budget. Since 2007, this has been a work in progress, but 20+ yesrs later, things are just getting interesting.
